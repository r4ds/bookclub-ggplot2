# Arranging Plots


**Learning Objectives**

- Produce several subplots part of the same main visualization
- A range of packages for providing different approaches to arranging separate plots



## Introduction

This chapter focuses on making more than one plot in one visualization, using the following packages:

1. patchwork
2. cowplot
3. gridExtra
4. ggpubr


## Arranging plots side by side with no overlap

```{r 09-library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r 09-dataplots, include=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

p2 <- ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = as.character(year), fill = drv), position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x = "year")

p3 <- ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = hwy, fill = drv), colour = NA) + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(drv))

p4 <- ggplot(mpg) + 
  stat_summary(aes(x = drv, y = hwy, fill = drv), geom = "col", fun.data = mean_se) +
  stat_summary(aes(x = drv, y = hwy), geom = "errorbar", fun.data = mean_se, width = 0.5)
```


```{r 09-plot1}
library(patchwork)

p1 + p2 # same as p3 | p4
```

```{r 09-plot2}
p1 + p2 + p3 + p4
```


### Taking control of the layout

```{r 09-plot3}
p1 + p2 + p3 + plot_layout(ncol = 2)
```

```{r 09-plot4}
p1 / p2
```

More compositions:
```{r 09-plot5}
p3 | (p2 / (p1 | p4))
```

### More about layouts

```{r 09-plot6}
layout <- "
AAB
C#B
CDD
"

p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + plot_layout(design = layout)
```

```{r 09-plot7}
p1 + p2 + p3 + guide_area() + plot_layout(ncol = 2, guides = "collect")
```


This way is possible a custom modification of the theme for one plot or for both.
```{r 09-plot8}
p12 <- p1 + p2
p12[[1]] <- p12[[1]] + theme_light()
p12
```

```{r 09-plot9}
p1 + p4 & 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 45)) & 
  theme_minimal()
```

### Plot annotations
```{r 09-plot10}
p34 <- p3 + p4 + 
  plot_annotation(
  title = "A closer look at the effect of drive train in cars",
  caption = "Source: mpg dataset in ggplot2",
  tag_levels = "I") &
  theme_gray(base_family = "mono")

p34
```

```{r 09-plot11}
p34[[2]] <- p34[[2]] + plot_layout(tag_level = "new")
p34 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = c("I", "a"))
```


## Arranging plots on top of each other

It is possible to arrange plots in a way that they are nested to each other, as well as setting the position inside the main plot.

General options are left, right, top, and bottom locations, but more specific locations can be set, such as using: `grid::unit()` (default uses npc units which goes from 0 to 1)

In addition, the location is by default set to the **panel area**, but can be align_to` **plot area**. 

An inset can be placed exactly 15 mm from the top right corner.

```{r 09-plot12}
p1 + 
  inset_element(
    p2, 
    left = 0.4, 
    bottom = 0.4, 
    right = unit(1, "npc") - unit(15, "mm"), 
    top = unit(1, "npc") - unit(15, "mm"),
    align_to = "full"
  )
```

```{r 09-plot13}
p24 <- p2 / p4 + plot_layout(guides = "collect")

p1 + 
  inset_element(p24, left = 0.5, bottom = 0.05, right = 0.95, top = 0.9)  +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A') & 
  theme_bw()
```



## Extra

**grid and gridExtra packages**
```{r 09-plot14, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```


**cowplot package**
```{r 09-plot15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(cowplot)

plot_grid(p1, p2, 
          labels = c('A', 'B'),
          align = "h",
          label_size = 12,
          label_fontfamily = "serif",
          label_fontface = "plain",
          label_colour = "blue",
          rel_widths = c(1, 2))
```


```{r 09-plot16, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
# We saved this to the images folder already.

# ggsave("images/p1.png", p1)

ggdraw()+
  draw_plot(p3)+
  draw_image("images/p1.png",x=0.4,y=0.4,scale=0.5)+
  draw_label("This is some text",x=0.5,y=0.9)
```



To add a common title we use `ggdraw()
```{r 09-plot17}
plot_row <- plot_grid(p1, p2)

# now add the title
title <- ggdraw() + 
  draw_label("Common title", 
             fontface = 'bold', x = 0, hjust = 0) +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 7))

plot_grid(title, plot_row,
          ncol = 1,
          rel_heights = c(0.1, 1))
```

```{r 09-plot18}
ggdraw()+
  draw_plot(p1,x=0.1,y=0,scale=0.5)+
  draw_plot(p2,x=-0.2,y=0,scale=0.5)+
  draw_label("This plot is made with cowplot",
             x=0.5,y=0.95,
             color="pink",
             fontface="bold",size=20)
```

**ggpubr package**
```{r 09-plot19, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(ggpubr)
ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 2, nrow = 2,common.legend = TRUE)
```


## Conclusions


[Patchwork - imaginist](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) is one of the packages mentioned in the book, also some other packages provide same results with different approaches.

```
00:27:47	Lydia Gibson:	What are npc unts?
00:27:56	Michael Haugen:	"npc" (Normalized Parent Coordinates)
00:28:02	Michael Haugen:	0 to 1
00:28:07	Lydia Gibson:	Oh okay. Thank you!
00:28:16	Michael Haugen:	Same thing that was used for faceting annotations.
00:28:43	Michael Haugen:	so .8 is l80 percent of the way up the y axis for example.
00:28:47	Lydia Gibson:	I missed annotations last week. I’ll have to go back and watch the session.
00:43:21	SriRam:	I use patch and cowplot
00:50:00	Kent Johnson:	https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/
00:50:09	Lydia Gibson:	Thank you!
00:50:17	Michael Haugen:	The arrows are in chapter 8.3 with geom and curve for example, annotate(
    geom = "curve", x = 4, y = 35, xend = 2.65, yend = 27, 
    curvature = .3, arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, "mm"))
  ) +
00:51:16	Michael Haugen:	and arrows came up in the discussion as a discussion of the GROB and arrows and how to render your plot so the arrows are not distorted.
00:51:16	Ryan Metcalf:	Perfect! “arrow” was the argument I was after!
00:51:37	Michael Haugen:	And then we talked about ggsave as a part of that
00:53:32	Michael Haugen:	we all will be at Cedric’s level by the end of this bookclub right?
00:53:47	SriRam:	:D
00:53:52	Lydia Gibson:	Hopefully lol
00:54:20	Ryan S:	Thank you!
00:54:29	SriRam:	Thank you

```
00:04:54	June Choe:	https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace-talk/
00:12:16	Ryan S:	brilliant... didn't know this before but really simplifies the concept
00:14:08	Michael Haugen:	Makes sense
00:26:15	June Choe:	https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_eval.html
00:26:36	Ryan Metcalf:	I’m thinking in the context….I buy a car. The engineers have optimized it for longevity….but I want a hot rod….So I need to open the hood and change parts. Or, access the computer and start changing parameters.
00:32:54	SriRam:	This is like scuba diving, more beautiful under the surface :)
00:33:15	Stan Piotrowski:	Great analogy, SriRam!
00:33:17	Ryan Metcalf:	Completely agree @SriRam!
00:36:44	June Choe:	ggplot2:::ggplot_build.ggplot
00:37:58	June Choe:	ggplot2:::print.ggplot
00:50:22	Federica Gazzelloni:	thanks June!!!
00:50:54	SriRam:	Out of curiosity, how much of this trickery (internal functions) can be learnt from "advanced R" or are these mentioned in the ggplot book ? I am just a regular user, I may not go this deep, but looks very interesting to explore/read during the Christmas break
00:51:12	Stan Piotrowski:	I’m in the same boat as SriRam
00:51:32	Stan Piotrowski:	Curious to know more about this but can definitely see myself getting lost in a rabbit hole
00:54:23	Ryan S:	at some point -- maybe a different session -- can we dive deep into the different stat options ("identity", "count", etc.)
00:54:47	Ryan S:	specifically, what do they do and when would you use them
00:55:09	Ryan Metcalf:	June, this is amazing!
00:57:27	SriRam:	Countdown starts...... 5 mins to come back to reality !!! :D
01:02:21	Stan Piotrowski:	Great talk, June!
01:02:34	Kent Johnson:	Thank you! See you next week!
