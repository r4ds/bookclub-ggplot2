# R4DS ggplot2 Book Club

Welcome to the R4DS ggplot2 Book Club!

We are working together to read [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen.
Join the #book_club-ggplot2 channel on the [R4DS Slack](https://r4ds.io/join) to participate.
As we read, we are producing [notes about the book](https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-ggplot2/).

## How to Present

This repository is structured as a [{bookdown}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bookdown) site.
To present, follow these instructions:

1. [Setup Github Locally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNUNPkoledI)
2. Fork this repository.
3. Create a New Project in RStudio using your fork.
4. Create a New Branch in your fork for your work.
5. Edit the appropriate chapter file. Use `##` to indicate new slides (new sections).
6. If you use any packages that are not already in the `DESCRIPTION`, add them. You can use `usethis::use_package("myCoolPackage")` to add them quickly!
7. Commit your changes.
8. Push your changes to your branch.
9. Open a Pull Request (PR) to let us know that your slides are ready.

When your PR is checked into the main branch, the bookdown site will rebuild, adding your slides to [this site](https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-URL/).
