# R4DS ggplot2 Book Club

Welcome to the R4DS ggplot2 Book Club!

We are working together to read [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen.
Join the #book_club-ggplot2 channel on the [R4DS Slack](https://r4ds.io/join) to participate.
As we read, we are producing [notes about the book](https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-ggplot2/).
